Dagger2 is dependandancy injection toolkit for android ,
it analyzes the dependencies of your app and generates code to help wire them together.

Iâ€™ve found that most of the tutorials about Dagger is complicated so, i myself write and example for understanding dependency injection via Dagger 2.
Hope it helps.
